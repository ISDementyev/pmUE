# pmUE
pmUE (Protein Modelling Unreal Engine) - a repo for constructing a molecule visualizer plugin in Unreal

### Main Ideas
1. Will use Unreal Engine (with C++) alongside Visual Studio 2019 for the majority of the work, with Doxygen-style commenting.
2. PMVR will be more akin to an Unreal plugin than a standalone "game"
