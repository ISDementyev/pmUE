# pmvr
PMVR (Protein Modelling Virtual Reality, Protein Modelling VR) - a repo for visualizing molecules in VR

### Main Goals
1. Find out which engine to use
2. Since we have chosen to go with Unreal (UE4), PMVR will be more akin to an Unreal plugin than a standalone "game"

### Research
1. Will use Unreal Engine (with C++) for the majority of the work.
