# pmUE
pmUE (Protein Modelling Unreal Engine) - a repo for constructing a molecule visualizer plugin in Unreal

### Main Ideas
1. Will use Unreal Engine (with C++) alongside Visual Studio 2019 for the majority of the work, with Doxygen-style commenting.
2. pmUE will be more akin to an Unreal plugin than a standalone "game"

### Collaboration
As the code is slowly being developed (and recently made online) it is recommended to open your own branch if you'd like to add anything to the project. All contributions welcome!
