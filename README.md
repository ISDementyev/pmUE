# pmUE
pmUE (Protein Modelling Unreal Engine) - a repo for constructing a molecule visualizer plugin in Unreal

### Main Ideas
1. Will use Unreal Engine 4 (with C++) alongside Visual Studio 2019 for the majority of the work, with Doxygen-style commenting (html file will be added in a docs folder)
2. pmUE will be more akin to an Unreal plugin than a standalone "game"
3. First the code will be designed standalone; it will then be edited into a format readable by the UE

### Collaboration
As the code is slowly being developed, it is recommended to open your own branch if you'd like to add anything to the project. All contributions welcome!

### Acknowledgement
If you use any of the code listed here (or the entire plugin) please say so in the acknowledgements section of your published media (e.g. journal, article, video, etc.).

A good template: "The molecular visualization was performed using pmUE (https://github.com/ISDementyev/pmUE)"
