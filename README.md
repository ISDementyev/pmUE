PMVR (Protein Modelling Virtual Reality, Protein Modelling VR) - a repo for visualizing molecules in VR

### Main Goals
1. Find out which engine to use (will likely go with Unreal)
2. Start researching on how Unreal engine and its programming language treats coordinates
3. Find out how to convert a pdb file into coordinates that are readable by the program - likely will require some string editing and parsing
4. Attempt to compile and run the program, maybe on an emulator?

### Research
1. Engines - start w/ Unreal
2. Which language the engine uses - probably a C-family one
3. How coordinates are treated - learn a little bit about them to get the hang of them (do I need to download any packages/modules for them?)
5. Find a way to apply this to the current project, especially with the pdb file format
